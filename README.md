#js-iain

iainkirkpatrick.me re-implemented in js + markdown parser, rather than use Jekyll and suffer the limitations of what is otherwise an excellent tool.

means that this repo will host the source, while iainkirkpatrick.github.io will host the dist.

###idea
build the site pieces as components, so that the different versions need only define their different styling and walla.
not sure how that will work wit MYST but it will for others.
